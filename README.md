# AI Stock Marker Summarizer
## Overview
This project retrieves the latest financial news and real-time stock market data, then uses a Hugging Face large language model (LLM) to summarize trends, highlight market movers, and provide insights for investors.

It is an AI-powered market intelligence tool with two versions:

Initial prototype: A simple Python script (basic_stock_summarizer.py) that fetches news and stock data, sends it to the Hugging Face LLM, and prints a summary in the console. This version is minimal and has no user interface.

Full app with UI: A Streamlit-based interactive web application (main.py) that provides a clean interface for users to input stock tickers, select date ranges, view news headlines and stock charts, and generate AI summaries on demand.

Initial Prototype (basic_stock_summarizer.py)
Fetches financial news from News API using a fixed query.

Retrieves recent stock data for a fixed ticker using Yahoo Finance.

Combines both inputs into a prompt and sends it to a Hugging Face LLM.

Prints the AI-generated market summary in the console.

No graphical or web interface, designed as a simple end-to-end proof of concept.

Full Application with Interface (main.py)
Built using Streamlit for a user-friendly, interactive dashboard.

Sidebar inputs allow users to enter any stock ticker and date range.

## Displays:

Latest finance news headlines (clickable links).

Interactive stock price charts.

On-demand AI-generated market summaries using Hugging Face LLM.

Includes loading spinners, caching for faster repeated queries, and error handling.

Provides a polished, modern user experience suitable for local use or deployment.

## Features (Both Versions)
ðŸ“Š Real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance
